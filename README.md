# Mantine v7 Templates

## Why?

I created this project as a way to learn the componentry of Mantine and to
challenge myself a bit. I found that more complete examples of Mantine on
CodeSandbox were written with v5 or worse, with styling and props that were
deprecated.

[Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/) is a great repository of templates and
many of them exist here too and are labelled as such.
